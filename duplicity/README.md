Duplicity reloaded !
====================

Duplicity is a great backup tool, however, it misses the web frontend I am looking for, so I decided to build it. This is a fork which aims to integrate several features already developped that may seem handy.

Dependencies
------------
See To Do


Installation
------------
At the moment, the official guide from upstream is valid : http://duplicity.nongnu.org/


Use
---
At the moment, the official guide from upstream is valid : http://duplicity.nongnu.org/

* The README-duplicity-manager.md file describes a simple wrapper (shell) which can be used.
* The README-duplicity-hubic.md file describes the use of the non-official Hubic backend (from OVH.com) 


To Do   
-----
* A frontend using bootstrap
* A web backend based on a django application
* Fill out the dependencies correctly (as the compilation of duplicity can be tricky on some debian machines)
